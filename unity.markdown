## 1. About <a name="about"></a>

The Unity Editor is a real-time 3D production tool for rendering photo-realistic animations, graphics, and models in an array of digital design contexts. The Editor is used across several industries, including games and cross-reality, television and film, architecture and construction, automotive, transportation, and manufacturing. As an all-in-one digital tool, the Editor contains dozens of functions and plugins to design a complete storytelling experience from initial design concept to release and distribution. Creators can synchronize graphics, animations, sounds, text, and the user interface all within the Editor. The Unity Editor is a powerful resource in the creation of digital content to create storytelling experiences for players and users.

As you can imagine, the Unity Editor can be quite useful if you are interested in building a digital storytelling experience that contains a variety of digital content. Creations with the Editor can range from 2D and 3D games to interactive fiction to animated shorts. In the documentation provided in this workshop, we only cover how you can create a role-playing game (RPG) using a pre-fabricated package of assets provided by Unity--meaning, we will show you how to make a game from beginning to end. However, Unity is incredibly robust, including the package of assets we will be using. So, while the intended length of this workshop is approximately 2 hours, you may find yourself spending dozens of hours creating additional content, designing your storytelling experience, and expanding the scale of your game's digital world. 

## 2. Resources <a name="resources"></a>

There are some fantastic resources out there to learn how to use the Unity Editor and to create engaging storytelling experiences. The most important resource to consult is the Unity Learn Platform which provides a rich catalogue of live and asynchronous workshops to explore the Editor's functionalities, plugins, and assets like the role-playing game package we will delve into further.



### 2.1 Tutorials <a name="tutorials"></a>

There are also some useful tutorials with a focus on digital research. 

### 2.2 Copyright <a name="copyright"></a>
Copyright has an impact on digital research activities, including the use of copyrighted assets, such as images and audio imported into Unity. Most post-secondary institutions have Scholarly Communication and Copyright offices with copyright guidelines on fair dealing. Check in with your scholarly communication and copyright office if you are not sure your data collection falls under fair dealing. For faculty, staff, and students at UTM, you can contact our [Scholarly Communication Librarian](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/scholarly-communications) to learn more about copyright fair dealing. The University has also put together a number of resources you can consult if you need a quick-and-fast answer:

[Copyright Fair Dealing Guidelines](https://provost.utoronto.ca//wp-content/uploads/sites/155/2018/06/Copyright-Guidelines.pdf)

[Copyright Road Map](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/copyright/utl_copyrightroadmap_february2020update.pdf)

Some other useful resources to consult on copyright fair dealing include:

Canadian Association of Research Libraries' [fair dealing documentation](https://fair-dealing.ca/what-is-fair-dealing/)  
The Writers Union of Canada's [fair dealing documentation](https://www.writersunion.ca/what-and-isn-t-fair-dealing)  
Council of Ministers of Education's [fair dealing decision tool](http://www.fairdealingdecisiontool.ca/DecisionTool/)

Note, these copyright resources only pertain to the [*Copyright Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/) for fair dealing in Canada and does not cover copyright in other jurisdictions. For international researchers please consult your own scholarly communication and copyright offices and resources on fair use or fair dealing of copyrighted works in digital research.
