Welcome to the Toolkit! You will notice there are a couple of sections to the website, including our [about](/toolkit/about/) and [workshops](/toolkit/workshops/). Each time there is a significant update to the content on this website I will create a blog post outlining the changes. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

We built the Toolkit to address scholars' needs for a place to find curated resources and documentation on how to gather, analyze, and publish research data. Over the Fall 2020, we will have four workshops on: Wget, TWARC, Instagram-Scraper, and Unity. Check back in the future for more workshops as they are developed.
