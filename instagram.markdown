### 2.2 Ethics <a name="ethics"></a>
Digital research ethics of online material is a constantly moving fence. Most post-secondary institutions have Research Offices with policies on the use of human data, which can include data posted on social media posted behind password protested accounts. Check in with your research office if the data you intend to collect from online sources was created by humans to learn more about ethical decision-making of online data. For faculty, staff, and students at UTM, you can contact our Research Office to learn more about [Ethics in Research](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/vp-research/information-researchers/ethics-research).

A good first resource to consult if you are wantin a quick-and-fast answer to your ethical decision-making of online data is the [Association of Internet Research's](https://aoir.org/) recommendations from its [Ethical Working Committee](https://aoir.org/ethics/). The Committee is constantly updating its documentation and its current recommendations along with a condensed information chart are a good starting point to determine your research ethics:
